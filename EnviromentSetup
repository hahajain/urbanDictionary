/*This file describes the steps to setup the environment on aws for the project*/

1.The project is setup on AWS ec2 instances. This requires creation of an amazon aws account and the launching of t2.micro 
instances with ubuntu/linux operating system.

  To initialise the mongoDB server,
        sudo service mongod start

5. To load data into the mongoDB server, 
    mongoimport --db *bigData * --collection *urbanDictonary * --type json --file *urbanDictonary.json*

6. Before setting up elasticsearch, ensure that Java8 or above is installed on the server.Setup elastic search on amazon ec2 instance using   
    sudo apt-get install elasticsearch

    network.host: "localhost"
    http.port: 9200
